# CI Failure Summary

**PR**: #1 - Replace sidebar with navbar/footer + clean meme grid
**Branch**: `redesign/navbar-footer-architecture`
**Run ID**: 18203677175
**Completed**: 2025-10-02T19:37:56Z
**Duration**: 1m10s
**Status**: ❌ FAILURE

## Failed Steps

1. **Run tests with coverage** - Test execution failed with 28 test failures
2. **Coverage Report** - Unable to generate coverage report due to missing coverage file

## Error Categories

### 1. **[CI FIX]** Coverage Report Generation Failure (BLOCKING)

**Error**: Missing `coverage/coverage-summary.json` file
**Impact**: Prevents coverage report from being posted to PR
**Root Cause**: Tests failed before coverage could be generated, but CI expects the file to exist

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/runner/work/sploot/sploot/coverage/coverage-summary.json'
```

**Analysis**: This is a CI infrastructure issue. The coverage report action runs even when tests fail, but the coverage file is only generated when tests complete successfully. The workflow needs to be updated to skip coverage reporting when tests fail.

### 2. **[CI FIX]** Missing Module Errors (7 test files affected)

**Affected Files**:
- `__tests__/api/search.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../utils/test-helpers'
- `__tests__/api/search-advanced.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../utils/test-helpers'
- `__tests__/api/cache-stats.test.ts` - Cannot find module '@/lib/multi-layer-cache'
- `__tests__/api/assets.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../utils/test-helpers'
- `__tests__/api/asset-crud.test.ts` - Cannot find module '../utils/test-helpers'
- `__tests__/integration/search-flow.test.ts` - Module not found
- `__tests__/integration/upload-flow.test.ts` - Module not found

**Root Cause**: Import paths in test files are incorrect or test helper files are missing from the repository. These are likely due to incomplete test migration or missing test infrastructure files.

**Analysis**: This is a CODE ISSUE. The test files reference modules that either don't exist or have incorrect paths. Need to verify:
1. Does `__tests__/utils/test-helpers.ts` exist?
2. Does `@/lib/multi-layer-cache` exist?
3. Are the import paths correct?

### 3. **[CODE FIX]** Mock Configuration Issues (3 test files)

#### upload-url.test.ts (7 failures)
```typescript
TypeError: mockAuth.mockResolvedValue is not a function
```
**Location**: Lines 24, 40
**Analysis**: The `mockAuth` object is not properly configured as a Vitest mock function. This is a test implementation bug.

#### upload-preflight.test.ts (3 failures)
```typescript
TypeError: file.arrayBuffer is not a function
ReferenceError: jest is not defined
```
**Locations**: Lines 138, 205
**Analysis**:
1. Missing polyfill for `File.arrayBuffer()` in test environment (CI infrastructure)
2. Incomplete Vitest migration - still using `jest.fn` instead of `vi.fn` (code issue)

### 4. **[CI FIX]** Date Serialization Issue

**File**: `__tests__/api/upload-preflight.test.ts:73`
```typescript
AssertionError: expected { createdAt: 2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z }
           to deeply equal { createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" }
```
**Analysis**: This is a CI-specific issue. The test expects a Date string but receives a Date object. Likely due to different JSON serialization behavior in CI vs local environment. This is a test implementation issue that needs fixing to work correctly in all environments.

## Test Failure Summary

**Total Tests**: 316
**Passed**: 288 (91.1%)
**Failed**: 28 (8.9%)

### Breakdown by Category:
- **Missing Modules** (CI setup): 7 test files blocked
- **Mock Configuration** (Code bugs): 10 failures
- **Date Assertion** (Test impl): 1 failure
- **Other Failures** (Existing): ~10 failures from db-asset-exists, distributed-queue, etc.

## Critical Path to Fix

### Priority 1: Unblock Test Execution (Missing Modules)
Fix module path issues so tests can at least run. This unlocks ability to see real test failures.

### Priority 2: Fix Coverage Reporting
Update GitHub Actions workflow to handle test failures gracefully.

### Priority 3: Fix Test Implementation Bugs
- Mock configuration in upload-url.test.ts
- Jest→Vitest migration in upload-preflight.test.ts
- Date assertion handling

### Priority 4: Address Remaining Failures
Continue work on db-asset-exists and distributed-queue test fixes (already in progress locally).

## Environment Differences

**Local**: Tests run but 28 failures
**CI**: Tests fail to run properly due to missing modules + all the same 28 test failures

**Key Insight**: The local environment has been working around the missing module issues (perhaps through node_modules resolution), but CI is more strict about module paths.
