# Sploot TODO - Prototype Phase

## üö® CURRENT STATUS: Non-Functional Prototype

The app has the UI built but **NOTHING WORKS** without external services configured. This is a prioritized list to get from mock prototype to working MVP.

---

## üî¥ BLOCKERS: Manual Setup Required (You Must Do These)

These external services are **REQUIRED** for the app to function. Without them, you're just looking at a pretty UI that does nothing.

### 1. **Clerk Authentication** ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes
**Status**: ‚ùå Not configured
**Impact**: Can't sign in, entire app is inaccessible

1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and sign up
2. Create a new application (free tier is fine)
3. Enable: Google OAuth, Email Magic Link
4. Get your API keys from the dashboard
5. Add to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your-key-here]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your-secret-here]
```

**Test it works**: `pnpm dev` ‚Üí Can you sign in? ‚úÖ or ‚ùå

### 2. **Vercel Postgres Database** ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes
**Status**: ‚ùå Not configured
**Impact**: Can't store any data, app crashes on most operations

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` and link to your account
3. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com) ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Create Database ‚Üí Postgres
4. **IMPORTANT**: After creating, click into the database and run this SQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```
5. Copy the connection strings to `.env.local`:
```env
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://..."
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgres://..."
```
6. Run migrations: `pnpm db:push`

**Test it works**: `pnpm db:studio` ‚Üí Can you see tables? ‚úÖ or ‚ùå

### 3. **Vercel Blob Storage** ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes
**Status**: ‚ùå Not configured
**Impact**: Can't upload images

1. In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Blob
2. Copy the token to `.env.local`:
```env
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_[your-token]
```

**Test it works**: Try uploading an image in the app ‚úÖ or ‚ùå

### 4. **Replicate API for Search** ‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes
**Status**: ‚ùå Not configured
**Impact**: Search doesn't work (core feature!)

1. Go to [replicate.com](https://replicate.com) and sign up
2. Get API token from account settings
3. Add to `.env.local`:
```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_[your-token]
```

**Test it works**: Upload image ‚Üí Does search find it? ‚úÖ or ‚ùå

## üü° KNOWN ISSUES (After Setup)

Once you've done the manual setup above, these are the current problems:

### Critical Bugs
- [ ] **Build fails with TypeScript errors** - Prisma schema field mismatch
  - `imageEmbedding` field doesn't exist in schema
  - Multiple hook errors with conditional calls
  - Need to fix or disable type checking for now

- [ ] **55 tests failing** - Mock infrastructure issues
  - Tests written but mocks not properly configured
  - Can ignore for prototype phase

### Missing Core Features
- [ ] **No image resize on upload** - Uploads full size (will eat storage)
- [ ] **No duplicate detection working** - Checksum code exists but not wired up
- [ ] **No tag system** - Database schema exists but no UI
- [ ] **No delete confirmation** - Deletes are instant (dangerous!)
- [ ] **No loading states** - UI freezes during operations

---

## üü¢ What Actually Works (Once Configured)

After you complete the manual setup:

‚úÖ **Authentication** - Sign in/out with Clerk
‚úÖ **Image Upload** - Drag & drop to Vercel Blob
‚úÖ **Basic Search** - Text ‚Üí embedding ‚Üí vector search
‚úÖ **Favorites** - Toggle favorite status
‚úÖ **PWA** - Installable web app
‚úÖ **Responsive Design** - Mobile/desktop layouts

---

## üìã Practical Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Get It Running (Today)
1. [ ] Complete all manual setup above
2. [ ] Add `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` to next.config.ts
3. [ ] Deploy to Vercel and test with real services
4. [ ] Verify core flow: Sign in ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Find image

### Phase 2: Fix Critical Issues (This Week)
1. [ ] Fix Prisma schema to match code or vice versa
2. [ ] Add error boundaries so app doesn't crash
3. [ ] Add loading spinners for upload/search
4. [ ] Implement image resize before upload (save storage costs)
5. [ ] Add delete confirmation dialog

### Phase 3: Make It Usable (Next Week)
1. [ ] Add tags UI (schema exists)
2. [ ] Implement duplicate detection properly
3. [ ] Add batch upload support
4. [ ] Create settings page for user preferences
5. [ ] Add export/backup functionality

### Phase 4: Polish (Later)
- Performance optimizations
- Better error messages
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Advanced search filters
- Share functionality

## üí° Quick Hacks for Prototype Demo

If you just need it working for a demo:

1. **Use mock mode** - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK_SERVICES=true` for fake data
3. **Disable type checking** - Add to next.config.ts:
   ```js
   typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true },
   eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }
   ```
4. **Skip tests** - They're broken anyway

---

## üìä Success Metrics for MVP

You have a working prototype when:

- [ ] You can sign in with your Google account
- [ ] You can upload 10 images
- [ ] You can search "cat" and find your cat photos
- [ ] You can mark images as favorites
- [ ] It doesn't crash during basic operations

Everything else is nice-to-have for a prototype.

## üóëÔ∏è Deprioritized (Moved from Previous TODO)

<details>
<summary>Click to see completed optimization work (not priority for prototype)</summary>

### Completed Optimizations
- [x] Consolidated SETUP documentation files
- [x] Removed empty .swc directory
- [x] Trimmed verbose JSDoc comments
- [x] Added conditional debug logging
- [x] Implemented build-time console stripping
- [x] Fixed build errors from optimization changes

### Skipped as Premature
- [~] Bundle size analysis - App needs to work first
- [ ] Further performance optimizations - Prototype doesn't need to be fast
- [ ] Code coverage improvements - Tests are already broken
- [ ] Documentation polish - Code needs to be stable first

</details>
