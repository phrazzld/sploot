# Upload Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The upload functionality was completely broken due to a React hydration mismatch error. The error occurred because the app was using `localStorage` in `useState` initializers, causing different values on server vs client render.

## Root Cause
```javascript
// BAD - causes hydration mismatch
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    return localStorage.getItem('viewMode') || 'grid';
  }
  return 'grid';
});
```

The server would render with 'grid', but the client might have 'masonry' in localStorage, causing React to fail hydration and break all interactivity.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed useState initializers** - Removed localStorage checks, use consistent defaults
2. **Added client-side loading** - Use useEffect to load localStorage after mount
3. **Added isClient flag** - Ensure safe client-side operations

## Testing Steps
1. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
2. Open http://localhost:3000/app in your browser
3. **Check Console** - Should NOT see hydration error
4. **Click "upload new meme" button** - Should toggle upload panel
5. **Drag and drop files** - Should accept image files
6. **Upload images** - Should successfully upload to server

## Expected Behavior
- No hydration errors in console
- Upload button is clickable and responsive
- Upload panel opens/closes when button clicked
- Files can be selected and uploaded
- View mode toggles (grid/masonry/list) work correctly

## Browser Extension Note
If you still see issues, try:
1. Disable browser extensions (especially cryptocurrency/wallet extensions)
2. Test in incognito/private mode
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage

## Verification Complete
✅ Hydration mismatch fixed
✅ Upload functionality restored
✅ All interactivity working
