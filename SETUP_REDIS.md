# Upstash Redis Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Upstash Redis for caching in your Sploot application.

## Why Redis Caching?

Redis caching provides significant performance improvements for Sploot:

- **Text Embedding Cache**: Repeated search queries hit cache instead of expensive API calls
- **Image Embedding Cache**: Already processed images skip re-processing
- **Search Results Cache**: Popular searches return instantly
- **User Data Cache**: Faster dashboard loads and asset counts

**Expected Performance Impact:**
- Search latency: 500ms ‚Üí 50ms (90% improvement for cached queries)
- API cost reduction: 60-80% for text embeddings
- Overall app responsiveness: 2-3x faster for repeat actions

## 1. Create Upstash Account

1. Go to [upstash.com](https://upstash.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

## 2. Create Redis Database

1. **Click "Create Database"** in the Upstash dashboard
2. **Choose configuration**:
   - **Name**: `sploot-cache` (or your preferred name)
   - **Type**: Select **"Regional"** for better performance
   - **Region**: Choose the region closest to your Vercel deployment
   - **Eviction**: Select **"allkeys-lru"** (removes least recently used keys when full)

3. **Review settings**:
   - **Free tier**: 10,000 commands/day (sufficient for development)
   - **Pro tier**: Consider for production with heavy usage

4. **Click "Create"**

## 3. Get Connection Details

After database creation:

1. **Go to your database dashboard**
2. **Find the "REST API" section**
3. **Copy these values**:
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` (e.g., `https://us1-xxx.upstash.io`)
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (e.g., `AAAxxxxxxx`)

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add the credentials to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Upstash Redis Configuration
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis-url.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_redis_token_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**:
- Replace the example values with your actual credentials
- Never commit these credentials to version control
- Use different databases for development/staging/production

## 5. Deploy Environment Variables

### For Vercel Deployment:

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
3. **Add both variables**:
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` = `https://your-redis-url.upstash.io`
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` = `your_redis_token_here`
4. **Select environments**: Choose "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
5. **Click "Save"**

### For Local Development:

Environment variables in `.env.local` are automatically loaded by Next.js.

## 6. Verify Cache is Working

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Check the console logs** for cache initialization:
   ```
   Cache service initialized successfully
   ```

3. **Test caching functionality**:
   - Perform a search query twice
   - Look for console logs showing cache hits:
     ```
     Cache hit: text embedding for "funny cats..."
     ```

## 7. Production Considerations

### Database Scaling

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 10,000 commands/day
- 256 MB storage
- Perfect for development and small applications

**Upgrading:**
- Monitor usage in Upstash dashboard
- Consider Pro tier ($0.2 per 100K commands) for production
- Set up alerts for approaching limits

### Regional Performance

**Best Practices:**
- Use the same region as your Vercel deployment
- US East 1 (us-east-1) is often optimal for global applications
- Monitor latency and switch regions if needed

### Security

**Environment Management:**
- Use different Redis databases for different environments
- Rotate tokens periodically (every 90 days)
- Monitor access logs in Upstash dashboard

### Cache Strategy

**TTL (Time To Live) Settings:**
- Text embeddings: 15 minutes (queries may evolve)
- Image embeddings: 24 hours (images are immutable)
- Search results: 5 minutes (content changes with uploads)
- User metadata: 30 minutes (changes infrequently)

**Cache Invalidation:**
- User uploads automatically invalidate their search/asset caches
- Manual cache clearing available via API for admins

## 8. Monitoring & Debugging

### Cache Statistics

Access cache health at runtime:
```bash
# In browser console or API testing
fetch('/api/cache/stats')
```

**Response includes:**
- Cache service status (enabled/disabled)
- Connection health
- Hit/miss ratios (if available)

### Common Issues

**"Cache service disabled" message:**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Redis URL format (must include https://)
- Confirm token is complete (they're quite long)

**Connection timeouts:**
- Check Upstash dashboard for service status
- Try different region if latency is high
- Verify network connectivity

**Missing cache hits:**
- Cache is automatically disabled if Redis fails
- Application continues working without cache
- Check console for specific error messages

## 9. Optional: Advanced Configuration

### Custom Cache Settings

You can customize cache behavior by modifying `lib/cache.ts`:

```typescript
// Adjust TTL values for your needs
const DEFAULT_TTL = {
  TEXT_EMBEDDING: 30 * 60, // 30 minutes instead of 15
  IMAGE_EMBEDDING: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days instead of 24 hours
  SEARCH_RESULTS: 10 * 60, // 10 minutes instead of 5
};
```

### Multiple Environments

For larger teams, consider separate Redis instances:

```env
# Development
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://dev-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=dev_token_here

# Production
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://prod-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=prod_token_here
```

## 10. Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Usage

**10,000 commands/day breakdown:**
- ~50 searches with cache misses = ~100 commands
- ~500 searches with cache hits = ~500 commands
- Leaves ~9,400 commands for other operations

**Optimization tips:**
- Cache hits use minimal commands (1 GET vs 1 SET + 1 GET for miss)
- Longer TTL = fewer cache refreshes = lower command usage
- Monitor usage patterns in Upstash dashboard

### Upgrading Strategy

**Consider upgrading when:**
- Approaching 8,000 commands/day consistently
- Response times degrade due to rate limiting
- Need higher storage for large embedding caches
