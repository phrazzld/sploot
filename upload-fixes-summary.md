# Upload Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. React Hydration Mismatch (First Issue)
**Problem**: Server and client rendered different initial states due to localStorage access in useState
**Solution**: Moved localStorage loading to useEffect, ensuring consistent initial render

### 2. 'files is not defined' Runtime Error (Second Issue)
**Problem**: Incomplete refactoring left 22+ references to undefined `files` variable
**Solution**:
- Added memoized `filesArray` computed from `fileMetadata`
- Replaced all `files` references with `filesArray`
- Added temporary `files` state to prevent `setFiles` crashes

## Current State
The upload functionality should now work without crashing. You can:
- Click the upload button
- Open/close upload panel
- Select and upload files

## Technical Debt / TODO

### Incomplete Refactoring
The component is in a transitional state between two architectures:
- **Old**: Array-based `files` state with `UploadFile[]`
- **New**: Map-based `fileMetadata` with `Map<string, FileMetadata>`

### What Still Needs Work:
1. **Complete Migration**: Remove temporary `files` state and fully migrate to Map-based approach
2. **Update Operations**: Convert all `setFiles` operations to properly update `fileMetadata` Map
3. **File Object Storage**: Properly use `activeFileObjects` WeakMap for File objects
4. **Consistency**: Ensure files and fileMetadata stay in sync until migration is complete

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Test upload functionality thoroughly
2. Monitor for any remaining issues
3. Plan complete refactoring to Map-based approach
4. Remove temporary workarounds once migration is complete
