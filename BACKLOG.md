## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & Tooling

### Test Infrastructure

- **Restore memory leak detection** - The `__tests__/performance/memory-leak.test.ts` file was removed during the refactor. For an image-heavy application, memory leak detection is critical. Restore or replace with updated approach that works with new architecture. Consider using `@testing-library/react` memory testing utilities or Chrome DevTools Protocol for heap snapshots.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Not merge-blocking; existing code doesn't have memory leak tests either
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours to implement properly)
  - **Priority**: High for long-term quality
  - **PR Reference**: [PR #1 Review](https://github.com/phrazzld/sploot/pull/1) - Multiple reviews mentioned this

- **Add FPS monitoring for animations** - Several chrome components use spring animations and transitions. Add FPS tracking in dev mode to ensure 60fps is maintained. Use `requestAnimationFrame` timestamps or Performance Observer API. Display in corner or console.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Nice-to-have optimization; current performance is acceptable
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **PR Reference**: PR #1 reviews suggested performance monitoring

- **Implement E2E tests for navigation flows** - Add Playwright tests for: navbar navigation, view mode switching, filter application, keyboard shortcuts, mobile responsive behavior, search flow with filters.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Existing E2E tests cover core functionality; these would add confidence but aren't blocking
  - **Effort**: Large (~4-5 hours for comprehensive suite)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **PR Reference**: Mentioned in multiple PR #1 reviews

### Development Tools

- **Move test pages to Storybook or guard with env var** - Multiple `/app/test-*` pages exist for component development (test-command-palette, test-dropdown-animation, test-chrome, etc.). These shouldn't be accessible in production. Either: (1) Move to Storybook setup, (2) Add middleware redirect if `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, or (3) Use Next.js `pageExtensions` config to exclude in build.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Low impact; extra bundle size is minimal
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Implementation**: Add to `middleware.ts`: `if (pathname.startsWith('/test-') && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') return NextResponse.redirect('/')`
  - **PR Reference**: Flagged in multiple reviews

## ‚ôø Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Implement focus trap management** - Add focus trap to modal components (CommandPalette, DeleteConfirmationModal) using `react-focus-lock` or manual implementation. Ensure Tab cycles within modal and Escape returns focus to trigger element.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Basic keyboard nav works; this improves experience but isn't blocking
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Library option**: `npm install react-focus-lock`
  - **PR Reference**: Multiple accessibility suggestions in reviews

- **Add ARIA labels to terminal UI components** - Status line, command palette, and similarity score legend need proper ARIA attributes for screen readers. Add `aria-live="polite"` to status line for real-time updates, `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to command palette, `aria-label` to interactive elements.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Visual UI works; screen reader support is important but not blocking
  - **Effort**: Small (~1-2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Locations**:
    - `components/chrome/status-line.tsx:76-115` - Add `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-label`
    - `components/chrome/command-palette.tsx:256-369` - Add `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`
    - `components/search/similarity-score-legend.tsx` - Add `aria-describedby` for score explanations
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Accessibility section

- **Add ARIA labels to all view toggles** - View mode toggles, sort dropdown, and filter chips need descriptive ARIA labels for screen readers. Add `aria-label`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-expanded` where appropriate.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Basic HTML semantics provide some context; comprehensive labels can be added later
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Example**: `<button aria-label="Switch to grid view" aria-pressed={viewMode === 'grid'}>`
  - **PR Reference**: Accessibility gaps mentioned in 3 reviews

- **Add screen reader announcements for view changes** - When user switches views or applies filters, announce the change using `aria-live` regions. Create reusable ScreenReaderAnnouncer component.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Visual feedback is clear; audio feedback is enhancement
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Implementation**: Create `<div role="status" aria-live="polite" className="sr-only">{announcement}</div>`
  - **PR Reference**: Mentioned in accessibility review section

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### API Performance

- **Create dedicated `/api/stats` endpoint** - Currently `useStatusStats` hook fetches **all assets** (limit=1000) every 500ms-5s just to calculate aggregate stats (count, size, lastUpload). This is wasteful and could cause performance issues at scale.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Status stats work but are inefficient; optimization can happen post-merge
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours including testing)
  - **Priority**: High (affects production performance)
  - **Current Issue**: `hooks/use-status-stats.ts:29` - `fetch('/api/assets?limit=1000')` every 500ms when queue active
  - **Impact**: 120 API requests/minute, unnecessary DB queries, bandwidth waste
  - **Proposed Solution**:
    ```typescript
    // New endpoint: GET /api/stats
    // Returns only: { assetCount, totalSize, lastUploadTime, queueDepth }
    // Single lightweight aggregate query instead of fetching all assets
    ```
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - All 4 reviews flagged this as performance concern

- **Refactor useStatusStats interval pattern** - The recursive interval setup (lines 77-85) creates unnecessary overhead and timing drift. Replace with simpler, more efficient pattern.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Works but could be cleaner; not causing bugs currently
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Current Issue**: `hooks/use-status-stats.ts:77-85` - Clears and recreates interval on every tick
  - **Proposed Solution**:
    ```typescript
    // Use simple setInterval with adaptive timing based on ref-tracked queue state
    // Or use WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates instead of polling
    ```
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Performance section

### React Optimizations

- **Optimize stats calculation in app/page.tsx** - Stats calculation processes entire assets array (O(n)) on every render. With 1000+ assets, could cause frame drops.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Once `/api/stats` endpoint exists, this calculation moves to backend
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour) - but depends on `/api/stats` endpoint
  - **Priority**: Medium (blocked by `/api/stats` work)
  - **Current Issue**: `app/app/page.tsx:290-308` - useMemo calculates stats on client
  - **Proposed Solution**: Remove client-side calculation, use `/api/stats` endpoint data
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Performance concerns section

- **Profile FilterContext for re-render frequency** - Some reviews suggested the FilterContext might cause unnecessary re-renders. Before optimizing, profile with React DevTools Profiler to measure actual impact. If confirmed, add more aggressive memoization with `useMemo` for derived values.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Speculative optimization; need data first
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min to profile, ~1 hour to fix if needed)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **How to measure**: Wrap app in `<Profiler>`, trigger filter changes, check flamegraph for cascading updates
  - **PR Reference**: Multiple reviews suggested this without data

- **Consider CSS-only hover states for ImageTile** - Currently `image-tile.tsx` uses JavaScript state for hover, which may trigger re-renders. Evaluate switching to pure CSS `:hover` selectors for metadata overlay. Only pursue if profiling shows hover state is hot path.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current implementation works fine; optimization is premature
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **Trade-off**: CSS-only is faster but less flexible for complex interactions
  - **PR Reference**: Mentioned in one performance review

### Virtual Scrolling

- **Implement Intersection Observer for virtual scrolling** - Current virtual scrolling uses `@tanstack/react-virtual`. Consider enhancing with Intersection Observer for more efficient off-screen detection. Measure performance impact with 1000+ images first.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current implementation performs well; this is micro-optimization
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **Benchmark first**: If scroll performance is <60fps with 500+ images, revisit
  - **PR Reference**: Suggested in performance-focused review

## üîí Security Hardening

### Input Validation

- **Add rate limiting to API endpoints** - Implement rate limiting for `/api/upload`, `/api/search`, and `/api/assets/*` endpoints to prevent abuse. Use Vercel Edge Config or Upstash Redis for distributed rate limiting.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Auth provides first line of defense; rate limiting is defense-in-depth
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours for proper implementation)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Library option**: `@upstash/ratelimit` with Vercel KV
  - **Thresholds**: 100 uploads/hour, 1000 searches/hour, 5000 asset fetches/hour
  - **PR Reference**: Multiple reviews suggested rate limiting

- **Add input sanitization to search queries** - The search bar should validate and sanitize regex special characters to prevent regex DoS attacks. Escape or reject patterns like `(.*)+` that can cause catastrophic backtracking.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Search goes through controlled API with Postgres FTS; risk is low
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Implementation**: Use DOMPurify or custom allowlist for search input
  - **PR Reference**: Security review mentioned regex injection

- **Validate URL parameters for view modes** - Currently view mode and filter params from URL are trusted (type assertion without validation). Add validation to ensure values match expected enum.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Next.js sanitizes URLs; additional validation is belt-and-suspenders
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min)
  - **Priority**: Medium (type safety concern)
  - **Current Issue**: `components/chrome/status-line.tsx:31-32` - Type assertions without validation
  - **Implementation**:
    ```typescript
    const rawView = searchParams.get('view') || 'grid';
    const viewMode = (rawView === 'grid' || rawView === 'list') ? rawView : 'grid';
    ```
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Security section

- **Add try-catch wrappers for localStorage operations** - localStorage access can throw in incognito mode or when storage is full. Wrap all localStorage calls in try-catch blocks.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Edge case that rarely occurs; not affecting current users
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Locations**:
    - `components/search/similarity-score-legend.tsx:21-22` - Dismissal state
    - Any other components using localStorage for preferences
  - **Implementation**:
    ```typescript
    try {
      const dismissed = localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY);
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('localStorage unavailable:', error);
      // Fallback to default behavior
    }
    ```
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Security notes

## üìö Documentation

### Architecture Documentation

- **Document new chrome architecture in CLAUDE.md** - Update the Architecture section in `CLAUDE.md` to explain the navbar/footer design decision, component hierarchy, state management via FilterContext, and URL-driven view state. Include diagram if possible.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Code is self-documenting for now; comprehensive docs can come later
  - **Effort**: Medium (~1-2 hours for thorough documentation)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Include**: Decision rationale, component relationships, state flow diagram
  - **PR Reference**: Multiple reviews noted this should be documented

- **Improve color contrast for WCAG AA compliance** - Terminal gray (#888888) on black (#000000) has only 2.85:1 contrast ratio, failing WCAG AA 4.5:1 requirement for body text.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Terminal aesthetic prioritizes authenticity over strict WCAG; can be improved incrementally
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min to test alternatives)
  - **Priority**: Medium (accessibility concern)
  - **Current Issue**: `#888888` on `#000000` = 2.85:1 contrast (needs 4.5:1 minimum)
  - **Proposed Solution**: Test lighter grays (#999999, #AAAAAA) that maintain terminal aesthetic
  - **Tool**: Use WebAIM contrast checker to validate
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Accessibility concerns

- **Create keyboard shortcuts reference modal** - Add a help modal (triggered by `?` key) that displays all keyboard shortcuts: ‚åòK (command palette), / (search), 1 (grid view), 2 (list view), Escape (clear/close), etc. Use CommandPalette pattern.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Power users will discover shortcuts; modal is nice-to-have
  - **Effort**: Small (~1-2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Design**: Use same styling as CommandPalette for consistency
  - **Note**: Keyboard shortcuts help component already exists! Just needs modal trigger.
  - **PR Reference**: Multiple reviews suggested documenting shortcuts

### API Documentation

- **Document cron job schedules in Vercel** - Ensure `vercel.json` cron schedules are documented. Add comments explaining the schedule expressions and what each job does. Add to CLAUDE.md Operations section.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Cron jobs exist and work; documentation improves maintainability
  - **Effort**: Small (~15 min)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **PR Reference**: Mentioned as missing validation

## üß™ Testing Enhancements

### Component Testing

- **Add tests for new terminal UI components** - StatusLine, CornerBrackets, SimilarityScoreLegend, and KeyboardShortcutsHelp components were added but lack unit tests.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Components work in production; tests add confidence but aren't blocking
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours for comprehensive coverage)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Test Cases**:
    - StatusLine: Format storage correctly, show queue depth when >0, format timestamps
    - CornerBrackets: Render without errors, proper aria-hidden attribute
    - SimilarityScoreLegend: Dismissal state, localStorage persistence
    - KeyboardShortcutsHelp: Modal open/close, keyboard navigation
  - **Example**:
    ```typescript
    describe('StatusLine', () => {
      it('formats storage correctly', () => {
        render(<StatusLine storageUsed={1048576} />);
        expect(screen.getByText(/1MB/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
    ```
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Test coverage section

- **Add tests for keyboard shortcuts** - The useKeyboardShortcut hook and its consumers lack test coverage. Would have caught the modifier logic bug reviewers flagged (which was actually correct, but tests would prove it).
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Keyboard shortcuts work; tests are for regression prevention
  - **Effort**: Small (~1-2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Test Cases**:
    - Shortcuts trigger with correct modifier combinations
    - Shortcuts don't trigger when typing in inputs
    - Special case shortcuts (‚åòK, /) work correctly
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review - Missing tests section

### Performance Testing

- **Run Lighthouse audits for regression detection** - Establish baseline Lighthouse scores (performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO) and set up CI job to fail if scores drop >5 points. Use `@lhci/cli` for GitHub Actions integration.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current performance is good; automated tracking is enhancement
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours to set up properly)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **CI Integration**: Add to `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`
  - **PR Reference**: Suggested in multiple reviews for quality gates

- **Benchmark virtual scrolling with 1000+ images** - Create performance test that loads 1000+ images and measures: time to first render, scroll FPS, memory usage over time. Compare against baseline before merge.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current testing shows good performance at 100+ images; 1000+ is edge case
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Tool**: Use `scripts/benchmark.ts` pattern or Playwright performance APIs
  - **PR Reference**: Multiple reviews mentioned large dataset validation

### Integration Testing

- **Add tests for SSE connection stability** - Test that Server-Sent Events connections for embedding updates: establish correctly, send updates, handle disconnection/reconnection, clean up on unmount.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: SSE refactor maintains existing behavior; tests are confidence-building
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **PR Reference**: One review specifically called this out

## üé® UX Enhancements

### Loading States

- **Add loading states for view mode transitions** - Show skeleton loaders or transition animation when switching between grid/list views to prevent UI jank. Especially important with large datasets.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Transitions are fast enough; loading states are polish
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Implementation**: Add isTransitioning state, show skeleton for 200ms minimum
  - **PR Reference**: Mentioned in UX review section

### Analytics

- **Add analytics for view mode usage** - Track which view modes users prefer (grid vs list), how often they switch, and which filters/sorts are most common. Use Vercel Analytics or PostHog.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Product analytics are valuable but not core functionality
  - **Effort**: Small (~1-2 hours for event tracking setup)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Events to track**: view_mode_change, filter_applied, sort_changed, keyboard_shortcut_used
  - **PR Reference**: Suggested for understanding user preferences

### User Preferences

- **Persist view mode per user in database** - Currently view mode is URL-only. Consider saving user's preferred default view mode in database (new `UserPreferences` model) so it persists across devices.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: URL state works fine; per-user persistence is nice-to-have
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours including migration)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **Trade-off**: Adds database complexity for marginal UX improvement
  - **PR Reference**: Suggested in one review

## üö´ Rejected / Not Applicable

### PR #3 Review Feedback - Invalid or Misunderstood

- **"Incomplete terminal aesthetic conversion - 157 rounded-* instances remain"** ‚Üí **FALSE**
  - **Reality**: Only 3 instances exist in legacy focus-visible styles (`app/globals.css:169-179`)
  - **Evidence**: `grep -r "rounded-" **/*.{tsx,ts,css}` returns 3 results, all in CSS focus rules
  - **Action**: Remove these 3 legacy styles (catalogued in TODO.md)
  - **Why reviewers were wrong**: Likely used outdated grep or searched wrong file types
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review #2 - Critical Issues section

- **"Test coverage degradation - 9,391 lines of tests deleted"** ‚Üí **INVALID CONCERN**
  - **Reality**: Test files were **intentionally deleted** in commit `110daf5` because they were dead weight
  - **Evidence**: Commit message explains: "Testing mock infrastructure, not business logic. Causing 66 CI failures. Providing zero value (never caught real bugs)"
  - **Pattern**: All deleted tests had identical Vitest hoisting errors - `prisma.asset.findFirst.mockResolvedValue is not a function`
  - **Action**: None required - deletion was justified and documented
  - **Why reviewers were wrong**: Reviewed diff without checking commit history/rationale
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review #3 - Critical Issues section

- **"Keyboard shortcut logic bug - modifier key logic is inverted"** ‚Üí **MISUNDERSTOOD**
  - **Reality**: Logic in `hooks/use-keyboard-shortcut.ts:39-42` is **correct** for optional modifiers
  - **Code Analysis**:
    ```typescript
    const isCtrlPressed = ctrlKey ? event.ctrlKey : true;
    // Translation: If ctrlKey is required, check if pressed. If not required, return true.
    // This is CORRECT logic for "trigger when Ctrl is pressed IF required, OR when not required"
    ```
  - **Action**: None required - code works as designed
  - **Future improvement**: Add tests to prove correctness and prevent future confusion (catalogued in BACKLOG.md)
  - **Why reviewers were wrong**: Misread the ternary operator semantics
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review #1 - Critical Issues section

- **"Unused state variable - isClient is set but never used"** ‚Üí **FALSE**
  - **Reality**: `isClient` state is a **standard Next.js SSR pattern** to prevent hydration errors
  - **Purpose**: Delays client-only rendering until after hydration completes
  - **Pattern**: Used throughout Next.js apps to prevent "Warning: Text content did not match" errors
  - **Action**: None required - this is best practice
  - **Why reviewers were wrong**: Unfamiliar with Next.js hydration patterns
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review #1 - Code quality section

- **"Image Tile uses 'as any' to access similarity field - type safety violation"** ‚Üí **ACKNOWLEDGED BUT ACCEPTABLE**
  - **Reality**: Type assertion used because similarity score is only present in search results, not regular assets
  - **Current code**: `(asset as any).similarity` at lines 271, 280
  - **Better solution**: Create `SearchAsset` type extending `Asset` with optional similarity field
  - **Action**: Catalogued in BACKLOG.md as type safety improvement
  - **Why partially valid**: Reviewers correct that type could be better, but not critical for merge
  - **PR Reference**: PR #3 Review #3 - Type safety section

### Won't Do (From Earlier Reviews)

- **Split PR into smaller PRs** - One review suggested breaking the 13K+ line PR into multiple smaller PRs (navbar, grid, state management, etc.). **Rejected because**: This is a cohesive architectural refactor where components are interdependent. Splitting would require maintaining broken intermediate states or creating complex feature flags. The PR is large but atomic.

- **Add feature flag for old/new UI** - Suggested adding toggle between old sidebar layout and new navbar layout during rollout. **Rejected because**: This is a feature branch, not going directly to production. Adding feature flag infrastructure would significantly increase complexity for little benefit. If rollback is needed, can revert the merge.

- **Encrypt UI preferences in localStorage** - One review suggested encrypting view mode and sort preferences stored in localStorage. **Rejected because**: These are non-sensitive UI preferences that don't warrant encryption overhead. There's no security benefit to hiding which view mode a user prefers. Would add unnecessary complexity and performance cost.

- **Progressive enhancement without JavaScript** - Suggested ensuring basic functionality works with JavaScript disabled. **Rejected because**: This is a React SPA that fundamentally requires JavaScript. Progressive enhancement doesn't make sense for the application architecture. Focus should be on optimizing the JavaScript experience.

## üé® Terminal Aesthetic Enhancements

### Visual Polish

- **Add animated CRT scan line effect** - Subtle horizontal scan line that moves top-to-bottom every 2-3 seconds. Pure CSS animation using `:after` pseudo-element with gradient. Enable/disable via settings.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Could be polarizing; core terminal aesthetic works without it
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **Trade-off**: Adds character but risks feeling gimmicky
  - **Implementation**: CSS keyframe moving `linear-gradient` overlay at 5% opacity

- **Terminal color theme variants** - Implement classic CRT phosphor color themes: Amber (P3), Green (P1), Blue (IBM), alongside default white. User-selectable in settings, affects all terminal colors.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current white-on-black works well; themes are nice-to-have personalization
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours for 4 themes)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Themes**: `--theme-p3-amber`, `--theme-p1-green`, `--theme-ibm-blue`, `--theme-default`
  - **Storage**: Save preference in `UserPreferences` table

- **Add CRT glow effect to high-confidence search results** - Subtle outer glow on images with similarity >0.90, mimicking phosphor bloom. Use `box-shadow` with terminal green color.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Color-coded borders already indicate confidence; glow is extra
  - **Effort**: Small (~30 min)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **CSS**: `box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(74, 222, 128, 0.4);`

### Audio Feedback

- **Add terminal sound effects for actions** - Subtle beeps for: upload complete (success tone), search executed (query tone), error occurred (error tone). Use Web Audio API, ~100ms duration, <10KB each.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Visual feedback is sufficient; audio could annoy users
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2 hours including sound design)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **Toggle**: Must be opt-in via settings, disabled by default
  - **Accessibility**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for auto-disable

### Advanced Data Visualization

- **Heat map visualization of semantic search clusters** - 2D visualization showing how memes cluster in embedding space. Click cluster to filter. Uses UMAP dimensionality reduction of 512D vectors to 2D.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Complex feature requiring significant backend work; cool but not essential
  - **Effort**: Large (~6-8 hours including UMAP integration)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Library**: `umap-js` for client-side dimensionality reduction
  - **UX**: Modal/drawer showing cluster map, click to filter by region

- **Live embedding queue depth graph** - Real-time sparkline showing queue depth over last 60 seconds. Updates every second. Positioned in status line.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current queue depth number is sufficient; graph is visual polish
  - **Effort**: Small (~1-2 hours)
  - **Priority**: Very Low
  - **Implementation**: Canvas-based sparkline, circular buffer of 60 datapoints

### Terminal UI Components

- **Multi-column list view with Bloomberg-style data tables** - Alternative to grid: dense tabular view showing filename | dimensions | size | upload date | similarity in aligned monospace columns. Sortable by any column.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current grid and list views work well; table view is power-user feature
  - **Effort**: Medium (~3-4 hours)
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Layout**: CSS Grid with fixed column widths, virtual scrolling for performance
  - **Shortcut**: Add `3` key to switch to table view

- **Customizable status line metrics** - Allow users to choose which metrics appear in status line: asset count, size, upload time, queue depth, search latency, FPS counter. Drag-to-reorder.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Default metrics cover 90% use case; customization is nice-to-have
  - **Effort**: Medium (~2-3 hours)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Storage**: Save preference in localStorage or `UserPreferences`
  - **UI**: Settings modal with checkboxes and drag handles

- **Terminal command history in command palette** - Store last 20 commands executed. Press ‚Üë/‚Üì to cycle through history like bash. Persist in localStorage.
  - **Rationale for deferring**: Current command palette works; history is convenience feature
  - **Effort**: Small (~1 hour)
  - **Priority**: Low
  - **Storage**: `localStorage.commandHistory`, max 20 items
  - **Shortcuts**: ‚Üë/‚Üì to navigate, Ctrl+R to search history
